# J-MFD: Japanese Moral Foundations Dictionary

# Overview
The Moral Foundations Dictionary ([MFD](https://moralfoundations.org/other-materials/)) is a list of English words related to each of five moral foundations (i.e., harm, fairness, ingroup, authority, and purity) and morality in general; it is used to measure morality in written texts. In order to analyze Japanese texts in the same framework of the [Moral Foundations Theory](http://moralfoundations.org/), we developed the Japanese version of the MFD (J-MFD) based on the original version by using two online linguistic resources and two corpora and with the aid of computational methods. The methodological details are described in the following paper.

The J-MFD ("[J-MFD_2018.dic](https://github.com/soramame0518/j-mfd/blob/master/J-MFD_2018r1.dic)") and a word-segmentation program ("[word_segmentation.py](https://github.com/soramame0518/j-mfd/blob/master/word_segmentation.py)") used to segment Japanese sentences into words are publicly available under the MIT License.
